day-2
``````

structure of the java program:

 
  every java program should start with by defining a class.
  
  class <classname>
  {
   
  }
  
  
q) why should we compile the java program?

  compilation done by java compiler.
  
  java compiler : it is system defined program.
  
  
 how can we compile the java program?

 we do have one command is there 

  open the command prompt
  cmd:/> javac <filename>.java
  cmd:/> javac Welcome.java

  
NOTE:
when you compile the java program , if it compiles successfully 
.class file gets generated with class name


 Welcome
 HelloWorld.class
 
 
 .java file contains source code. 
 
 .class file contains bytecode.
 
 bytecode will be generated by compiler and this is not human readable
 code.
 
 
 
   -platform independent.
   
   
 
 
 
 jvm
 
we have to execute this file.


to execute this we have to give this .class file as an input to jvm 

  jvm will convert this bytecode to binary code.
  
  
what is the commadn to execute this java program?

  open the command prompt
  
   cmd:/> java HelloWorld


How to compile:
 
  javac <filename>.java
  
How to execute : 
   java <classname>
   
   
 note:
 
  every java program execution starts from main method.
  
  jvm internally invokes this main method.
  
  
java is object oriented programming language?

  because it follows oops principles.
  
  to achieve these oops principles in java we are using two concepts
  
   1.class
   2.object
   
   
class:
`````

class is the collection of variables and methods into a single unit.
this single unit is known as class.



variable:
 it is the name which we are giving to the memory location .
 
 
    100->memory area->system will generate one name 
	 
	 PQR444234234KLADJF
	 
	 stid=100;
	
	
while we are storing the data, we have to specify the type of the data. 
then only syntacticlly it is correct.
	
	numeric 
	character 
	string 
	float 
	...
	
	
for each and every type of data java provides some predefined data types
those are known as primitive data types.

note:
in java, datatypes can be categorized into 4 types

integer

  -byte
  -short
  -int
  -long

character

  -char

float

  -float
  -double

boolean 

  -boolean 
  
  
every datatype is having their own memory size and as well as 
range.

formula to calculate the range of any datatype:

 byte -> 1 byte -> 8 bits
 
 
  -2^n-1 to (2^n-1) - 1
  
  -2^7 to 2^7 -1
  
  -128 to 127
  
  byte b =100;
  short s = 100;
     int i = 100;
  long l =100;
  
  
 to store single character we have to use this char dataype
 
 character data always must be enclosed with in the single quotes.
 
   char c = 'a';
   
   float f = 123.45f;
   
   
note:
by default float data is of double type.

so that is why to store any float type after value must we have to 
add one character i.e f.

boolean :

  to store logical values whether it is true of false.
  
   boolean b = true;
   boolean b1 = false;
   
  note: 
  true and false are not normal words, these are java reserved keywords
  undefined 

  

variable syntax:
 
   variable initialization .
   
   
   
 <dataypename> <variablename> = <value>;
 
 int x;//variable declaration 
 x=100;//assignining the value
 int x = 100;//varaible initialization
 
 
method:
```````
method is the place where we are writing the logic to perform some operations based on requirement.


syntax:

   [accessmodifier] <returntype> <methodname>([if any parameters])
   {
      //logic
   }

example:

    void display()
	{
	  System.out.println("welcome to methods");
	}
	
    int getSalary()
	{
	  return 1000;
	}
	
	int sum(int a, int b)
	{
	   return a+b;
	}
	
	
	 sum(100,200);
	
	
 
 note: return type and return value must be compatible otherwise 
 it gives you compile time error.
 
while we are defining the methods we should follow some naming convention.

  GETAGE()

  getAge()
  getStudentInfo()
  
  
  
class is a collection of variables and methods into a single unit. 
that single unit is known as class.

 ex:
    
  class Student
  {
    //variables
    int stid=100;
    Strig stname="rama";
	
	//method name
	public void display()
	{
	 System.out.println(stid);
	 System.out.println(stname);
	}
 }
 
day-3:
```````
class is a collection 
 -variables
 -&methods 
 
 class <classname>
 {
 
   //varaibles
   
   //methods
 
 }
  
  
 object:
 ```````
 object is an instance of a class.
 
 instance:
 
  allocating sufficient amount of memory space for the non static properties 
  which we are defining inside the class. 
  
  
  note:
  for a single class, how many object(s) we can create?
  
   answer: as many as we want based on the requirement.
   
   
  
 1000 students.

 1000 student object.

 
  syntax to create the object:
  
   <classname> <objectname> = new <classname>();
   
   Student obj = new Student();
   
   Student obj1 = new Student();
   
   
   Student -> name of the class
   
   obj -> name of the object
   
   =  -> assignment operator
   
   
   new -> dynamic memory allocation operator
   
   Student() -> constructor
   
   
 // -> single line comment

/*

 */ -> multiline comment.

 
   
 example:
``````````
class Student
{
 int stid=100;
 String stname="Rama";
 
 public void display()
 {
   System.out.println("student id is : " + stid);
   System.out.println("student name is : " + stname);
 }
 
 
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    
	Student obj = new Student();
	
     System.out.println("student id is: " + obj.stid);
	 System.out.println("student name is : " + obj.stname);
	 System.out.println("===================");
	 //call the display() method
	 
	 obj.display();
	 
	 
 }
 
 }
 
 
instance vs static:
````````````````````
inside the class we can define instance properties and as well 
as static properties based on the requirement.

int stid;
static int stid;

void display()
{
}

static void display()
{
}

note:
to make any property as static property we have to use one java 
reserved keyword i.e static.


  
  
  college
   
     1000 students
	 
	   stid
	   stname
	   mobile
	   collegename
	   
	   
if a property is common for all the object(s) we can define that proeprty 
as static.

for static properties memory will be created at the time of class loading.
which is done by classloader subsystem it is the part of jvm.


	   
 static proeprties we can access using in these three possible ways.

  1.using classname(if property in one class, calling from another class)
  2.direct access (if property and calling is done in the same class)
  3.using object (not recommended)
  
  
  not static properties always we can acess using object name.
  
  
 instance(nonstatic) vs static area:


   
 the area which belongs to instance method or non static method is known 
 as instance area.
 
 
    //instance method
    public void display()
	{//instance area
	
	}
	
	public  static void  display()
	{
	//static area
	}
  
  
    java execution starts from main()
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
	  //static area
	
	}
  


note:
````
from static area, to access the non-static properties using object name
it is possible.

from instance area, to access the instance properties direct access is 
possible.


from any area either instance / static area to access static properties
we do have following 3 possible ways.

   1.direct access
   2.using classname
   3.using object name(it is not at all recommended)
   
   
Student.java:
``````````````

{
	//non static properties

 public void display()
 {
	 //non-static or instance area
   System.out.println("student id is : " + stid);
   System.out.println("student name is : " + stname);
     System.out.println("student collegename is : " + collegeName);
	 System.out.println("student collegename is : " + this.collegeName);
	 System.out.println("student collegeName is: " + Student.collegeName);
 }
 
 
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    //static area
	Student obj = new Student();
	
     System.out.println("student id is: " + obj.stid);
	 System.out.println("student name is : " + obj.stname);
	 
	 System.out.println("student collegename is : " + collegeName);
	 System.out.println("student collegename is : " + obj.collegeName);
	 System.out.println("student collegeName is: " + Student.collegeName);
	 
	 System.out.println("===================");
	 //call the display() method
	 
	 obj.display();

	  sum(10,20);
	  
	  //call the add() which is instance method
	  
	 Demo obj = new Demo();

note: the code which we are writing inside ide is autocompiled.

 
eclipse is open source 
 -apache software foundation 
 url: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/helios/sr1/eclipse-ide-java-developers
 
 
 
  



example:
````````

public class Test {
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//primitive type
		int x = 100;

		//auto boxing - primitive type to object type

        int z = y.intValue();
        
        System.out.println(z);
       
		
	}

}




autoboxing and unboxing:
`````````````````````````
Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.


from jdk 1.5 version onwards these conversions are happening automatically 
by the java compiler.




String to Object and Object to String Conversion:

example:
`````````

public class Test {
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//primitive type
		int x = 100;

		//auto boxing - primitive type to object type
        Integer y = Integer.valueOf(x);
        
        String z = y.toString();
        
        //int number = Integer.parseInt(z);
        Integer p = Integer.valueOf(z);
        
        System.out.println(z);
       
		
	}

}


type casting:
`````````````
we can perform this type casting at two levels.

 1. at primitive level 
 2. at referecne/object level 


type casting: 
conversion of one type data into another type data.

1. implicit type casting/widening type casting

       converting lower type to higher type 
	   
	   
	   it takes place 
	   both data types must be compatile with each other 
	   
	   the target type must be larger than the source type.
	   
	   
	   byte->short->char->int->long->float->double 
	   

example:
`````````

public class Test {
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		char c = 'a';
		int x =c;
		long y = x;
		float z = y;
		
		System.out.println("before conversion, char value: " + c);
		System.out.println("after conversion , int value: " + x);
		System.out.println("after conversion , long value: " + y);
		System.out.println("after conversion , float value: " + z);
		
	}

}


	    
2. explicit type casting/narrowing type casting

       converting higher type data to lower type data
	   
	   double -> flaot -> long -> int ->char ->short -> byte
	   
	   
example:
`````````

public class Test {
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		double d = 456.666;
		
		//converting double data type into long data type
		
		long l = (long)d;
		
		//converting long data type into int dataype
		
		int i =(int)l;
		
		System.out.println("Before conversion: " + d);
		System.out.println("After conversion into long type: " + l);
		System.out.println("After conversion into int type: " + i);

 operators  & flow control statement
 
 constructor:
 ````````````
 object:
 
   instance of a class is known as object
   
   instance: to allocate/create the enough memory space for instance   properties of the class
 
 
  syntax:

    <classname> <objectname> = new <classname>();
	
	Student obj = new Student();
	
	
	Student() -> method 
	
   
 constructor is a special member method.
 

rule: constructor name and class name always must be same
      constructor should not return anything even void also.
	  
purpose:
      to initalize the object
	  
	  
    	  initialization -> assigning the values 
		  
		  
		majorly we do have two types of constructors


1.default constructor/no-args constructor
  -it is a constructor which doesn't takes any parameters
  
  -system defined default constructor
  
     -it will be generated by java compiler when we don't define any 
	  constructors inside the class.
	 
     -purpose: it will initialize the default values based on the 
               datatype.

  integer category datatypes -> default value -0
  float -0.0
  char -> single space
  String -> null
  boolean -> false

  
	  
  -user defined default constructor
  
  
    purpose: this will be intilizing our own values.
	
	
  
  
  note:
  `````
  java compiler first invokes default values into the object 
  and later our own values will be replaced.
  
  
example:
`````````

public class Student {
	// non-static properties
	int stid;
	String stname;

	// user defined default constructor

	/*
	 * public Student() { stid = 100; stname = "rama"; }
	 */

	// java compiler generates one system defined dc

	/*
	 * public Student() { stid=0; stname=null; }
	 */
	
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("student id: " + stid);
		System.out.println("student name: " + stname);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// static area

		Student obj = new Student();
		// calling display() method using object name
		obj.display();
	}

}

  
  
  
2.parameterized constructor
		

   it is a constructor which takes parameters based on the requirement.
   
   
 note:
 when we are defining any parameterized constructor java compiler will 
 not generate any system defined default constructor.
 
 
note:
whenever we create the object automatically corresponding constructor(s) will get invoked.

example:
``````````

public class Student {
	// non-static properties
	int stid;
	String stname;

	//define double parameterized constructor
	public Student(int x, String y)
	{
		stid=x;
		stname=y;
	}
	
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("student id: " + stid);
		System.out.println("student name: " + stname);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// static area

		Student obj = new Student(100,"rama");
		// calling display() method using object name
		obj.display();
		
		Student obj1 = new Student(101,"benny");
		obj1.display();
	}

}


advantages of defining constructor:
`````````````````````````````````````

  ->in case of constructor(s) we no  need to invoke explicitly the moment 
    we create the object(s) corresponding constructor(s) will get invoked.
	
  ->it is used to initalize the object.
  
  
difference between default constructor and parameterized constructor:

 in case of user defined default constructor, first compiler places the default values 
 into object and later our values will be replaced into the object.
 
 
 in case of parameterized constructor, directly our own values will be
 placed into an object.
 
 

for example in my class i have 1000 constructors are there ?

   

this keyword in java:
``````````````````````
whenever we declare class level variables and constructor level parameters
both are same to differentiate we have to use this keyword before class level  variables.




example:
``````````



public class Student {
	// non-static properties
	int stid;
	String stname;

	//user defined default constructor
	public Student()
	{
		stid=102;
		stname="bhaskar";
	}
	// double parameterized constructor
	public Student(int stid, String stname)
	{
		this.stid=stid;
		this.stname=stname;
		
	}
	
	public void display() {
		System.out.println("student id: " + stid);
		System.out.println("student name: " + stname);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// static area

		Student obj = new Student(100,"rama");
		// calling display() method using object name
		obj.display();
		
		Student obj2 = new Student();
		obj2.display();
		
		
	}

}






this():
```````


this() -> it is used to call current class default constructor

this(...) -> it is used to call current class parameteized constructor


example:
```````
//example on constructor chaining 
public class Student {
	// non-static properties
	int stid;
	String stname;

	//user defined default constructor
	public Student()

note:
`````
while we are calling/invoking the current class constructor(s) this invocation  we have to stop in some constructor otherwise we will get 
compiletime error saying that recursive constructor invocation is not possible.

``````
constructor calling always must be the first executable statement otherwise

inheritance:
````````````
 inheritance is the process of acquiring the properties from parent class 
 to child class.
 
 inhreitance is also known as is-a relation.
 
 to achieve the concept of inheritance we require minimum two classes
 with parent-child relation.
 
 
 ->reusablity
 ->code redundancy will be decreased
 ->performance of the application will be improved.
 
 
polymorphism:
`````````````
defining one action into many forms.


  class  person --> mentor object
  
  -->class son object
  
  -> class customer 
  
  compiletime polymorphism
  runtime polymorphism
  
->it allows programmers to reuse, evaluate and execute the program
->reducess coupling betwee different functioanlites.

 ->method overloading->readability of the code
 ->method overriding
 
   float rateOfInterest()

types of inheritances:
```````````````````````
  single inheritance
  multilevel inheritance
    multiple inheritance -not possible through the concept of classes.
  hierarchical inheritance
  hybrid inheritance
  
  
simple inheriance:
 
   it contains one parent class one child class
   
   
  
A
|
B

multilevel inheritance:

it contains one parent class, one child class and multiple intermediate 
parent classe(s).



A
|
B
|
C

  class A {}
  class B extends A{}
  class C extends B {}
  

intermediate parent class:
this is also a class in one context it is acting as child class and in 
another context it is acting as a child class. 


multiple inheritance:
``````````````````````

  A B C ...
  
    Z
	
	mutliple inheritance contains 
	multiple parent clases 
	and single child class .
	
	class A{ m1()}
	class B{ m1()}
	class C{ m1()}...
	
	class Z extends A,B,C...
	{
	  Z obj = new Z();
	  obj.m1();
	}
	
note:
`````
using extends keyword we are always extending one class at a time.

hierarchical inheriance:
````````````````````````
    A

B   C  D....


It contains single parent class and multiple child classes


class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}
class D extends A{}



Hybrid inheritance:

  it is a combination of any two possbile inheritance type(S).
  
  A

C  D  E ...

Make sure in that combination multiple inheritance is not allowed.

note:
````
when we apply the inheritance concept, it is highly recommended to create
the object for child class.

when we create the object for child class, two memory copies won't be 
generated for both parent class and child class only one memory copy 
gets generated and that will be accessed by both parent class and as wella
as child class.

poly -many

 we do have two types of polymorphisms are there
 1.compile time polymorphism
 2.runtime polymorphism
 

method overloading-
method overriding-




method overloading:
```````````````````

  method overloading is the process of defining the method name as same
  by changing signature.
  
  
    method name is same
    signature is different
	  -no.of arguments
	  -type of arguments
	  -order of arguments 
	  
	  
  public void m1(int x)
  {
    //logic
  }
  
  public void m1(float x)
  {
    //logic
  }
  


demo program:
``````````````
package com.jse.inheritance;

public class Test2 {
	
	
	public void m1(int x)
	{
		System.out.println("integer argument");

		Test2 obj = new Test2();
		obj.m1(100);
		obj.m1("rama");
		
		
		
	}

}

compile time polymorphism:
``````````````````````````
this is the polymorphism where method resolution or binding can be decided
at compiletime by the java compiler based on the reference variable not 
based on the object type.


method overloading is the best example for compile time polymorphism.

example:
````````
package com.jse.inheritance;

public class Test2 {
	
	
	public void m1(int x)
	{
		System.out.println("integer argument");
	}
	
	public void m1(float x)
	{
		System.out.println("float argument");
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//object declaration 
		Test2 obj;
		//object referencing
		obj= new Test2();
		
		obj.m1(100);//method resolution will be happend at compile time based on reference variable
		obj.m1(3.4f);
		
		
	}


}



example on method overloading with automatic/implict promotion:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
package com.jse.inheritance;

public class Test2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//object declaration 
		Test2 obj;
		//object referencing
		obj= new Test2();
		
		obj.m1(100);//method resolution will be happend at compile time based on reference variable
		obj.m1(3.4f);
		obj.m1('c');//integer argument
		obj.m1(20L);//float argument
		
		//compile time error:obj.m1(34.56);
	
	}

}

note:
`````
if exact match is not there java compiler will give the prefernce to subclass version i.e.the method which is accepting String as an argument.

example:
`````````

	}

}


note:
````
to perform method overloading one java class is enough.


method overriding:
````````````````````

   it is the process of defining method name as same 
   but logic is different from parent class to child class.
   
   note:
   to perform method overriding, minimum we require two classes 
   with parent child relation.
   
   
note:
`````
it is highly recommended to use @Override annotation on top of overriding 
method.

example:
`````````
package com.jse.inheritance;

public class Parent  {
	//overriden method
	public void operation(int x, int y)

public class Test1 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		
		Child obj = new Child();
		obj.operation(4, 5);
	}

}


note:
`````
private methods can't be overriden.

note:
`````
while we are overridng the method, it is always possible to increase the
visibility scope not possible to decrease the scope of the visibility.

   private < default < protectd < public.
   
   
note:
``````
final methods can't be participated in overriding.


non final to final is possible while we are overriding.

but final to not final is not possible.

method overriding with respect to exceptions. we do have some rules.

runtime polymorphism:

method resolution can be happend at runtime based on the object type 
not based on the refernce variable.

abstract class:
```````````````
partial implementation class.

in java, we have two types of classes 

  ->concrete class / implementation class/fully defined class
  
  ->abstract class /parital implementation class //undefined classs
  
  
  
concrete class: is a class which contains only defined methods

defined method: it is a method which contains method heading + method body

abstract class: 
it is a class which contains both defined methods and as well as 
undefined methods also.

  abstract class Test1{
     //concrete method
     void m1(){System.out.println("m1");}
	 //abstract method or undefind method 
     abstract void m2();
  
  }
  
    
	


note:
`````
to make normal method as an abstract method we have to use abstract keyword
explicitly.

if a class contains atleast one abstract method the corresponding class 
also will become as abstract class.


q)are we able to create the object for abstract class or not?

 no, we are not allowed to create the object for an abstract class.
 
 
 
 
if a method is going to be common for all the implementation classes 
then it is highly recommended 

method name is common 
but logic is different from one implementation class to another implementation  class.

Test1.java:

		Test1 obj;

can we define constructor inside an abstract class?

   yes we can define
   
  constructor(s) always executed whenever we create the object.
  
  
because for every constructor super() statement is added by the java compiler internally 
which inturns calls parent class constructor(s).


note:
if we want to define the implementation class for any abstract class 
we have to provide the logic for all the abstract method if you are not 
providing the logic for atleast one abstract method then the implemention 
class also will become an abstract class.

  abstraction in java using two 
  
  1.abstract class
  2.interface
  

2.interface:
``````````````
interface is a collection of only abstract methods only unimplemented methods.

basically interface is used to provide or declare specifications. 

 >security,maintainence,enhancements,...
 
 
 syntax:
 
            interface <interfacename>
			{
			
			   //abstract methods
			}

how can we bring the properties from interface to class?

  using "implements" keyword 

  
  
  
extends -> class to class or interface to interface (homogenious)
implements -> interface to class to provide the logic

note:
if we take the properties from interface to class, we have to provide the

also will become as abstract class.


note:
we can define the implementation class by implementing from more than one interface since java supports multiple inheritance through the concept of 
interface.

the process of taking the properties from interface to another interface

 advantage: data hiding 
 
encapsulation is the process of wrapping up of variables and methods 
into a single unit.


 to make any java class as an encapsulated class, we have to follow 
 below rules.
 
  1.each variable must be private(data hiding)
  2. for every variable we have to maintain both  public getter methods and as well as public setter methods.

  
note:
using encapsulaion, we do have more control on top of data.
