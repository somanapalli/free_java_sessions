								  what is java?
								  
								   java is object oriented programming language
								   
								   
	
  what is the goal of programming language?

   
            to develop the software/application 

 			
	we do have two types of applications 
	
	 1.desktop application 
	 
	   desktop applications results are not sharable across the globe.
	   
	   
	   calculator
	   acroabtic reader
	   antivirus.
	   ....
	   
	   
	 2.distributed application
	 
	   results are sharable across the globe make sure you have proper internet connection.
	   
	   
	   facebook
	   gmail
	   flipkart
	   amazon...
	   
	
java got released in which year:
  1995
who is author?
  james gosling 
he released this software from which organization?

 sunmicrosystem





 he releaesd this software into threee editions
 
 
  1.jse
  
     ->desktop applications
	 
  2.jee
  
      ->desktop applications + distrubuted applications
	  
	  
  3.jme
  
     ->java micro/mobile edition 
	 
	 android 
  
significance of learning core java/jse:

->to implement desktop applications/standalone applications

->to learn jee

->to learn popular tools mulesoft,salesforce,tableu,hadoop...



1995
27 years back 

  because of it's java unique features.
  
  -13 features
  
  -simple
  -pi
  -an
  -dynamic
  -interpreted
  -multithreaded
  -secured
  -portable
  -object oriented 
  
  ....
  

platform independent:
`````````````````````

 c is platform dependent
 
 
 <filename>.c -> compile -> .exe ->windows os
 
 unix operating system 
 
   can't 
   
 
  compiled 
  executed
  
  
platform independent:
 
  .java ->.class file ->windows os
  
  yes
  
  java slogan -> wora -> write once run anywhere
  
  
  java software 
  
   
  
why java is object oriented?

 since this pl follows oops principles ->omg(object management group)-candian organization 
 
 
 
 inheritance
 polymorphism
 abstraction 
 encapsulation 
 
 .net,pyhton,php,cpp...
 
 


java is open source

java is case sensitive programming language


java -> sunmicrosystem

in recent years copy rights of sunmicrosystem reserved by oracle corporation 

 
  scjp

prerequistites to write the java program:
`````````````````````````````````````````
1.download the java software(jdk) and then install
2.select the editor (notepad,some ide's)eclipse,netbeans,myeclipse, 
2.write the java program 
4.save this java progra (<filename>.java)
5.compile the java program (.class)->java compiler
6.execute the java program ->output ->java interpretor (jvm)


jdk,jre,jvm:
```````````

jdk 
  java development kit
  https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/
  
  
i wanted to cross check whether it gets installed or not?

open comand prompt and pass below command

  
    cmd:/> java -version 
	

with this jdk?
 am i able to write the java program 
 yes
 am i able to execute the java program 
 yes
 
 it provides 2 environments
 
  1.development environments
  2.runtime environments
  
  
 jre: java runtime environment 
 
 using this jre, 
 are we able to develop the java programs?
 no
 are we able to execute the java applications
 yes
 
 
 jvm: 
  java virtual machine
  
   using this we are able to execute the java program 
   
   

jdk = developement environment + jre
